# Requirements Specification Document for AR-Warehouse Management System (AR-WMS)

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the detailed requirements for the AR-Warehouse Management System, designed for small computer stores and adaptable for in-home computer and accessories inventory management. The system leverages augmented reality to improve inventory tracking, management accuracy, and operational efficiency.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
AR-WMS is a modular system integrating computer vision, AR visualization, a backend inventory database, and user-facing AR applications on mobile or wearable devices.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Real-time inventory visualization with AR overlays.
- Product recognition via machine learning and image processing.
- Inventory database management with CRUD operations.
- Alerting for low stock and restocking needs.
- Multi-environment operation: warehouse and home.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- Warehouse staff managing inventory in commercial settings.
- Individual users managing personal computer accessories at home.
- Users have basic familiarity with mobile devices and AR applications.

### 2.4 Constraints
- System assumes availability of smartphones/AR glasses with cameras.
- Requires reliable network connectivity for real-time data synchronization.
- Privacy and security must be ensured for personal inventory data.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Inventory Data Management
- The system shall store product details including category, model, manufacturer, SKU, serial number, purchase and warranty info.
- The system shall track stock quantities, reorder levels, conditions, and locations.
- The system shall support barcode and QR code scanning; RFID support is planned.

#### 3.1.2 AR Visualization and Interaction
- The system shall recognize products and locations via camera input.
- The system shall display inventory information overlays in AR.
- The system shall alert users to low stock and restocking via AR cues.

#### 3.1.3 Backend API
- The system shall provide RESTful APIs for communication between backend and AR frontend.
- The system shall ensure secure authentication for user access.

### 3.2 Non-functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- The system shall update inventory data and AR displays with latency under 1 second.

#### 3.2.2 Scalability
- The system shall accommodate expansion to additional products or storage locations without redesign.

#### 3.2.3 Security
- The system shall use encrypted communication channels.
- The system shall restrict access based on user roles.

#### 3.2.4 Usability
- The AR interface shall be intuitive and accessible for both warehouse staff and home users.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Hardware Interfaces
- Supported on smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses equipped with cameras.

### 4.2 Software Interfaces
- REST API endpoints to be defined for inventory management.
- Integration capability with external ERP systems is desired.

## 5. System Architecture
- Backend in Python (FastAPI/Flask).
- Frontend AR apps in Unity or native mobile technologies (ARCore/ARKit).
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- Machine learning models for object recognition via TensorFlow/PyTorch.

## 6. Success Criteria
- At least 30% reduction in time locating items.
- 50% improvement in inventory accuracy.
- High usability satisfaction in user testing.
