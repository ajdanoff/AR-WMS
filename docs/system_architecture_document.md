# AR-Warehouse Management System (AR-WMS)  
## Initial System Architecture Document

### 1. Overview  
The AR-WMS system integrates backend inventory management, an AR-based frontend visualization, device hardware, and communication interfaces. Designed for both small computer store warehouses and in-home computer/accessory inventory use cases, it aims to streamline inventory tracking, improve accuracy, and increase user efficiency.

### 2. Architectural Components

#### 2.1 Backend Inventory Service  
- **Description:** Centralized service managing all inventory data.  
- **Technology:** Python with FastAPI or Flask; PostgreSQL or SQLite database.  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Provide secure RESTful API for frontend communication.  
  - Maintain data persistence, integrity, and synchronization.  
  - Handle concurrent update and query requests.

#### 2.2 AR Frontend Application  
- **Description:** User-facing application delivering real-time AR visualization and interaction.  
- **Technology:** Unity or native mobile apps leveraging ARCore/ARKit.  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Capture camera input and perform product/shelf recognition using OpenCV and ML models.  
  - Overlay inventory data and alerts onto real-world views.  
  - Accept user input for stock updates or restock requests.

#### 2.3 Computer Vision & Machine Learning  
- **Description:** Subsystem for image processing and object recognition.  
- **Technology:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch.  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Train on product image datasets for identification accuracy.  
  - Perform inference locally or server-side as needed.

#### 2.4 Hardware Interface  
- Devices: Smartphones, tablets, AR glasses with cameras and network connectivity.  
- Optional integration with barcode/QR scanners or RFID readers.

### 3. Data Flow Model

1. User points device camera at product or storage location.  
2. AR app captures video feed and sends to computer vision module.  
3. Vision module detects recognized objects or labels.  
4. Frontend queries backend service via REST API for inventory details.  
5. Backend returns relevant inventory metadata.  
6. AR frontend overlays data on camera feed in real time.  
7. User interacts via AR interface to update inventory or request restocking.  
8. Backend processes updates and synchronizes data.

### 4. Deployment Diagram (Conceptual)  

- Backend API hosted on cloud-based or local servers.  
- AR frontend deployed on mobile devices and AR glasses.  
- Secure HTTPS communication between frontend and backend.  
- Possible edge computing nodes for local ML inference (performance optimization).

---

### 5. Security and Performance Considerations  

- Enforce HTTPS and OAuth or JWT for API security.  
- Authenticate and authorize users with role-based access control.  
- Optimize ML model size and compute location to balance latency and battery usage.  
- Cache frequently accessed inventory data on frontend devices to minimize network traffic.
