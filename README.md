# AR-Warehouse Management System (AR-WMS)

## Project Overview  
The AR-Warehouse Management System (AR-WMS) enhances inventory management in small computer stores and home environments by overlaying augmented reality information on real-world storage locations. It enables quick product identification, visual stock verification, and streamlined picking/restocking through user-friendly AR interaction.

## Features  
- Real-time inventory visualization with AR overlays  
- Object detection powered by computer vision and ML  
- Adaptable for warehouse and in-home use  
- Mobile and wearable device compatibility  
- Backend API for inventory management and updates  

## Technology Stack  
- Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/SQLite  
- OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- Unity or native ARCore/ARKit apps  
- Smartphones, tablets, AR glasses
